# GameAssay
A pipeline for measuring the effective evolutionary game played by an empirical population.

For context, you can read a blog-length [introduction to the game assay](https://egtheory.wordpress.com/2019/02/16/python-game-assay/) or consult the paper:

Kaznatcheev, A., Peacock, J., Basanta, D., Marusyk, A., & Scott, J. G. (2019). Fibroblasts and Alectinib switch the evolutionary games played by non-small cell lung cancer. _Nature Ecology and Evolution_. (available in preprint as [_bioRxiv_, 179259](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/179259v6)).

The raw data is in /Processed and the well layout is in DataLoad.py

A very rough notebook used for protyping the game assay is available as MeasuringGame.ipynb. This code is poorly commented and hard to follow. A better organized and commented version of this code will follow.
